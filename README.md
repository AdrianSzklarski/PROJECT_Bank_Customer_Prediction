# Bank Customer Prediction

## Purpose of the program

This is a machine learning project where we will be building a model to predict the types of cards a bank might sell or try to sell to its customers


## Describe

In a dataset that contains information about people who use cards issued by a particular bank, we find certain characteristics of these people, which include information about family, marital status and how often and how they use cards issued by the bank. We will now use this dataset to predict the type of car a particular customer might be able to buy. 

The project is divided into 3 parts:
1. Building a machine learning model - predicting the type of car a customer might buy;
2. Django-based web application;
3. deployment of the project on Heroku via GitHub.
